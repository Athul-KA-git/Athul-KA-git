## Hi there 👋
 

I’m **Athul**, a Technical Artist & Unity Developer based in India 🇮🇳  

I design and build real-time experiences where **art meets engineering**.  

If an idea involves games, XR, simulation, or interactive visuals,  
there’s a good chance I’m already experimenting with it.

My main focus is **game development, Unity (C#), XR (AR/VR/MR)**, and  
building **training simulations & digital twins**.  
I enjoy optimizing assets, creating tools, and solving technical problems
that sit between artists and engineers.

I’ve been working on projects around **XR safety training, simulations,
and real-time 3D workflows**, and I’m currently exploring  
**NVIDIA Omniverse, WebXR, and intelligent digital twins**.

I have a few pinned projects below — mostly Unity, XR, and experimental work.
